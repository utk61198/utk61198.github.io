## EDUCATION
- CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY
  - Master of Information Systems Management, Business Intelligence & Data Analytics 
- SHIV NADAR UNIVERSITY
  - Bachelor of Technology, Computer Science and Engineering

## SKILLS
- Core Skills: Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Deep Learning, Data Engineering, Inferential Statistics, Machine Learning Theory


## WORK EXPERIENCE

- **CAPITAL ONE**

  - **Data Science Intern (Anti Money Laundering Team) 6/2023 - Present** 

    -  Developed a standardized data science package for the Anti Money Laundering team.Package enabled automated tuning and feature selection of AML models.Interoperable with scikit-learn, supporting the entire data science pipeline.
    - Reduced turnaround time for model experimentation and report generation.
    - Improved efficiency of reporting Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) and AML alerts.
    - Employed various sampling strategies to handle highly unbalanced datasets.
    - Contributed to a more accurate identification of suspicious activities.
    - Strengthened the organization's ability to combat financial crimes effectively.

- **DELL TECHNOLOGIES**

  - **Software Engineer – 1 8/2021 - 7/2022**
  
    - Engineered REST APIs using NodeJS and Python to distribute Enterprise Analytics Applications to 4000+ employees.
    - Increased the enterprise applications’ CI/CD maturity scores by 32% therefore improving the end-user experience of more than 16,000 employees globally by making the applications more secure and stable
    - Designed an application using React Native to help visually impaired employees navigate; The application is internally deployed in the production environment of 4 different offices of Dell Technologies.

  - **Software Development Intern (RSA) 3/2021 - 6/2021**

    - Deployed SAML 2.0 authentication integrations with 16 different SaaS providers which supported Single Sign on (SSO), RADIUS, and Relying Party protocols using RSA Cloud Authentication

  - **Undergraduate Software Development Intern 5/2020 - 7/2020**

    - Created customized Workday Integrations for cloud applications to analyze HR and Finance data for Asia-Pacific employees
    - Developed a recommendation tool using Natural Language Processing to extract data from resumes and recommend a suitable candidate according to the job description from a pool of 200 candidates

- **AMAR UJALA WEB SERVICES**

  - **Machine Learning Summer Intern 5/2019 - 7/2019**
    - Implemented Sentiment Analysis, Intent Analysis, Subject Verb Object (SVO) detection, and Auto Keyword Tagging to create a personalized news feed for more than 8000 users on Amarujala.com
    

## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- EFFICIENT FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING COVARIATE SHIFT IN MACHINE LEARNING 9/2021 - 1/2022

  - Created a framework to reduce the computational cost for finding a pair of the correct re-weighting algorithm (KMM, RuLSIF, KLIEP) and Deep Learning model (DenseNet121, ResNet50, and a baseline CNN) to tackle Covariate Shift and get the most optimal model performance
  - Proposed methodology encompasses a comprehensive empirical evaluation across MNIST-C, CIFAR10- C, SVHN, and STL-10 datasets; Reduced the computational search space for finding the pair by 56.25% while achieving near-best accuracy

- SERVICES AND SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 11/2020 - 12/2020

  - Devised a web application using Flask powered by content-based filtering that used web activity data to recommend 300 product and services; The Machine Learning model also used user feedback to improve the recommendations

- PUBLIC TWEETS SENTIMENT ANALYZER 1/2020 – 2/2020

  - Built a web application to analyze and classify 5000 recent public tweets based on a given hashtag into 3 different sentiments

## PUBLICATIONS

- The Role of ESG in Sustainable Development: An Analysis through the Lens of Machine Learning.

  2021 IEEE International Humanitarian Technology Conference, [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9698939)
  - Constructed a novel dataset housing ESG parameters for conducting regression analysis of more than 1400 corporations listed in the stock exchanges worldwide
  - Successfully developed a random forest regressor to accurately predict the growth variables such as “profit margin” and “return on equity” and increased the adjusted R square by 5%. -->
